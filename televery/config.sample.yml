# Appname is a unique identity given to an app that possibly uses
# two-factor verification.

# Only trusted apps can make a verification request.  Apps that are
# not trusted will receive nothing but "DENY".
#
# Suggestion: use random strings to make them harder to predict.  You
# can see appnames as some form of secret token.
